It enables administrators to request, issue, monitor, renew, and revoke certificates through a secure, user-friendly interface.</p> <p>In modern IT environments, digital certificates are critical for securing communication, authenticating systems, and ensuring data integrity. Managing these certificates manually can be complex, error-prone, and risky\u2014especially when dealing with large infrastructures or multiple certificate authorities (CAs). CLM addresses these challenges by offering:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Centralized Management \u2013 A single interface to handle certificates from request to retirement.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automation \u2013 Reduce manual effort by automating renewals, alerts, and status tracking.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compliance &amp; Security \u2013 Enforce organizational policies, ensure timely renewals, and maintain audit trails for compliance.</p> </li> <li> <p>Visibility &amp; Control \u2013 Gain real-time insights into certificate status, expiration timelines, and usage across systems.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The CLM web application is designed for administrators and security teams who are responsible for ensuring secure, uninterrupted operations of enterprise systems. By using CLM, admins can minimize downtime caused by expired certificates, mitigate security risks, and maintain compliance with industry standards.</p>"},{"location":"#accessing-clm","title":"Accessing CLM","text":"<p>Administrators can access the Certificate Life Management (CLM) application through a standard web browser.</p> <ul> <li> <p>URL: <code>https://clm.companyname.com</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Supported Browsers: Latest versions of Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and Safari.</p> </li> <li> <p>Network Requirements: Ensure your device has network access to the CLM server and that any VPN or firewall settings allow secure HTTPS traffic.</p> </li> </ul> <p>For security purposes, always verify that you are connecting to the official company CLM URL and that the connection is established over HTTPS.</p>"},{"location":"#login","title":"Login","text":"<p>After accessing the CLM application link, administrators are presented with the Login Page. </p> <ol> <li> <p>Enter Credentials</p> <ul> <li> <p>Provide your assigned Username and Password in the respective fields.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your organization has enabled Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), you will be prompted to complete the additional verification (such as entering a one-time code or approving a push notification).</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Submit Login</p> <ul> <li>Click on the Login button to proceed.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Successful Login</p> <ul> <li>Upon successful authentication, the system redirects you to the Dashboard, which is the starting point for all certificate management activities.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Unsuccessful Login</p> <ul> <li> <p>If the credentials are incorrect, the system will display an error message.</p> </li> <li> <p>Ensure that the details are entered correctly.
